description: '"It is a magnificent epic," said William H. Prescott after the publication
  of History of the Conquest of Mexico in 1843. Since then, his sweeping account of
  Cortes''s subjugation of the Aztec people has endured as a landmark work of scholarship
  and dramatic storytelling. This pioneering study presents a compelling view of the
  clash of civilizations that reverberates in Latin America to this day.'
